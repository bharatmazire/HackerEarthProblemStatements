Baby loves to play with numbers. So, here he has a number N. He finds the factorial of N. Then he rotates the digits of Factorial(N) by Z places and get number X. Then finds the Digest sum of the X and add the number of digits in the factorial of N. 
Suppose, he has number N=5 and Z=2. Factorial of 5 is 120. Rotating the factorial by 2 places will give X=201. Now the digest sum is the sum of a number recursively until it is less than 10. So, digest sum is 3 and number of digits in the factorial of N=5 is 3. So, the output should be 3+3=6.

Input Format:
You are give two numbers N and Z.

Output Format:
Output will contain the digest sum as described above.
