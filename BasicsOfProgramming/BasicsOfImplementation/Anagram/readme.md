[Actual Problem statement from HackerEarth link](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/anagrams-18-9e0ab2f3/description/)

You are given two strings that may or may not be of the equal length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make given two strings anagrams. Any number of characters can be deleted from either of the string.Can you help that team to find this number?
**INPUT FORMAT **

The first line contains the first input string.
The second line contains the second input string.
**CONSTRAINTS **

1≤length(a)≤10000.
1≤length(b)≤10000.
The inputs are Case insensitive
** OUTPUT FORMAT **

If the two strings are already anagrams print

TWO STRINGS ARE ALREADY ANAGRAMS.


Else print the number of characters to be deleted.
